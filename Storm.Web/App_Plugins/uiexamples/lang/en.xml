      <p>This package is developed and maintained by the Umbraco Package Team. Contributions are welcome: <a href="https://github.com/umbraco/UI-Examples" target="_blank">visit the GitHub repository</a>.</p>
      <p>It contains an overview of several backoffice elements and shows you how to use them. Each UI example is linked to from a tab in the section header.</p>
      <p>The package is also great reference material, if you see something within this section - that isn't covered on one of the tabs - you can go to your App_Plugins folder and check the source.</p>
      <p>Everything in this package is front-end only (except for a bit of code that automatically adds this section to all user groups).</p>
